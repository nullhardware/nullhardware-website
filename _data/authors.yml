    Hardware designer by day; hacker by night. My expertise lies in analog and mixed-signal circuit design with emphasis on reliability and extended operation in extreme environments. 
    I possess advanced knowledge of power electronics, PCB design and SPICE simulation. In my spare time I can be found photographing landscapes and immersing myself in particle- and astro-physics.

    I've had a soldering iron in my hand since before I had a drivers license, and have the burns to prove it.
    Embedded Systems Engineer by day, and embedded hacker by night, specializing in hardware and firmware integration.
    I play with software defined radio's, copy RFID fobs, and try to break embedded devices as a hobby.

    Hardware/firmware designer by training; husband and father by calling; software developer, hacker, photographer, maker, and welder by hobby. I like to make stuff (then often just give it away). 
    I love taking pictures of landscapes, sunrise/sunset, waterbodies - nature in general. 
    With a NAIT diploma in Electronics Engineering Technology, I know how to build stuff; and with University degree in Electrical Engineering, I know why it works that way...
