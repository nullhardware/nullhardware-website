# PicoCTF 2018 - Binary Exploitation Challenges

We've solved every single last PicoCTF 2018 Binary Exploitation challenge. Read our writeups to up your hacker game and learn what you've been missing. For more information on what PicoCTF is, read our introductory [Blog Post]({% post_url /featured/2020-08-11-Hacking-the-pandemic-away %}).

***NOTE*: These writeups are a work-in-progress. Keep coming back as content is updated regularly.**

## Getting Started

**Required tools**: ssh client

Strictly speaking, you should be able to do almost all of the challenges without any additional tools than what is available on the ssh server.

However, I would recommend downloading the problems and working locally. For Ubuntu systems, you'll want to do the following:

```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libc6-dbg lib32stdc++6 libc6-dbg:i386 libstdc++6:i386
```
{:.contains-term}

Which should allow you to execute 32-bit binaries on a 64-bit Ubuntu installation.

In addition, you'll likely want to install packages for **binutils**, **python3**, **pwntools**, **netcat**, and **nasm**.

### Windows Users

Fear not, it is relatively easy to work on these problems from your windows machine (*I did*). At the end of the day, these are linux binaries, so you will still need access to a linux instance to run them. Both Docker and WSL2 will allow you to have complete linux instances running in a virtual machine. WSL1 is also an option, and will get you surprising far, but the caveat is that 32-bit binaries are explicitly not supported by WSL1, so you will have to run those challenges on the shell server.

## List of Challenges

### 1. [buffer overflow 0]({% link _reference/Hacking-101/PicoCTF-2018-Binary-Exploits/buffer-overflow-0.md %}) (*150 Points*)

> 
```
$ ./vuln abcd
Thanks! Received: abcd
```
> The trick with this challenge is to make the program segfault (in the right way). The binary already registers a segfault handler that, if successfully executed, will print out the flag. All you have to do? **Make it crash**!

Define functions like ': <name> <opcount> <op1> <op2> ...'
 Example: ': add 1 +' defines a function add with one operation which executes '+'.
Good luck!
