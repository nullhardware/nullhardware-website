# Getting Started

1. Install docker
2. run "docker-compose up" [once running, you can use CTRL-C to get back to the terminal. Docker will keep running.]
3. Load "http://127.0.0.1:4000" in your web browser
4. Edit!
5. use "docker-compose stop" to stop the docker container, or "docker-compose down" to completely clean it up.

Once you're done, commit your changes to github. The website will automatically update.
