I will derive and present a simple fixed-point approximation to sin (and cos) appropriate for embedded systems without dedicated floating-point hardware. It is accurate to within Â±1/4096 (0.01% Full-Scale).

## Background

I originally derived this implementation with an MSP430 in mind. This particular chip had a full integer 32x32 HW MAC, completing most integer multiplications within a couple of cycles. I wanted to avoid the vendor-supplied floating point routines mostly because I had already managed to avoid them entirely in an near-complete project and felt no reason to introduce them now. If performance is required, this general approach should be optimized for your particular hardware.

This post is inspired (and a derivative of) the excellent [Another fast fixed-point sine approximation](http://www.coranac.com/2009/07/sines/). Although excellent, for my application, I ended up requiring the full 5th order approximation to meet the design specifications.

Since this is a 5th order approximation, I will restrict the derivation discussion to {% katex %}\sin(x){% endkatex %} (which is odd). The cosine can be calculated from the sine with a simple phase shift.

## Domain

The domain of {% katex %}\sin(x){% endkatex %} is infinite. However, it only provides unique (positive) values within the range {% katex %}x \in [0, \frac{\pi}{2}]{% endkatex %}. All the other outputs can be calculated based on the values within this range and the symmetry of the sine function.
